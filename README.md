# lein-scss-compiler

A Leiningen plugin to compile SCSS files to CSS.

This plugin is very much in alpha stage, contains a lot of hard coded values and
the performance is poor.

## Usage

Put `[lein-scss-compiler "0.1.4"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

Run `lein scss-compiler` before packaging your Clojure software.
